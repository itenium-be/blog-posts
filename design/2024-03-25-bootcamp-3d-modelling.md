For our bootcamp this year, Tom Pauwaert introduced us to the Unreal Engine.
We started from the course materials of Emiel Sleegers to build a landscape
inspired by the grandeur of ancient Rome and Greece.

## Fake it!

We started the bootcamp with a short introduction to "Game Graphics Production"
followed by a Unreal Engine 101 where Tom also let us in on the game industry's biggest
secret: fake it!

Don't create 6 different versions of something. Create just the one and then copy/paste, rotate,
enlarge, play with lighting, materials and no one will notice they are looking at the same thing
copied over and over!

As true developers this was easily accepted, and so we got to work!


# Lunch

## Finishing Touches

After lunch, there were additional demos on some more advanced Unreal Engine functionality:
make it all look even better by playing with light, fog, elevations and finish up the landscape
with terrain and foliage assets.
