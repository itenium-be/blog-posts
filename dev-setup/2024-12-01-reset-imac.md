  Apple products are so easy and straightforward to use,
  that is, until you need to do anything involving the
  Apple Account.

A friend got himself a second-hand iMac but couldn't log in
because he didn't have the Apple Account credentials.

Create them an account at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com),
the shit already starts there, get ready to confirm the email once and
your friends' phone like, literally, a gazillion times.

# The Steps

- Turn on the iMac AND
- Press and hold `Command + R` until it boots into Recovery Mode
- Reinstall macOS

If that worked great! But it will probably fail with a 403 Forbidden
when trying to download the OS.

- Turn off
- Turn on AND
- Press and hold `Command + S` until it boots into a terminal

```sh
mount -uw /
rm /var/db/.applesetupdone
shutdown -h now
```

# Reboot

At this point, you're almost there!

You'll probably get stuck when trying to accept the Terms & Conditions:

- Go back
- Do NOT login into your iCloud Apple Account
- Accept the Terms & Conditions

Once in the OS, you can go to System > iCloud to login the Apple Account.  
At that point you can also kill the old user.

# Conclusion

Best not to tell anyone you are in IT ðŸ˜ƒ
