Last Thursday we built our own MacroPad at itenium.
During this session the focus was on learning to solder
and putting everything together, all under the supervising eye
of Michiel.

# The Components

A [microcontroller](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/others/seeed-studio-seeeduino-xiao-rp2040-dual-core-cortex-m0-separate-headers), [1 rotary encoder](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/switches/manual-switches/rotary-encoders/rotary-encoder-module) and [6 keyboard switches](https://www.alternate.nl/Sharkoon/Gateron-PRO-2-0-BROWN-Switch-Set-keyboard-switches/html/product/1892291).

# Final Touches

Making them buttons actually do something using [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/).

## What's Next

To make our MacroPads truly our own, we definitely have to do a followup Autohotkey session ðŸ˜Ž
