  First we went from Flux to Redux. And now to the Toolkit?

  It certainly comes with a learning curve... Is it worth

We're 2025 and you start a new app with old, trusted and deprecated `create-react-app`,
only to find out that using Redux is also, deprecated.

During previous migrations I took a long hard look at the [ReduxJS/Toolkit documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
and I was like... Aint nobody got time for that!

For the last migration, I decided to give it go and well, I can already say with conviction,
it is worth the time learning. Reduced boilerplate, batteries included and while the full
documentation is still daunting, you can take it step by step.

# Immer

{% include github-stars.html url="immerjs/immer" desc="Create the next immutable state by mutating the current one" %}

Before we actually start with ReduxJS/Toolkit (RTK), let's take a step back.

The application I was migrating, was using [`ImmutableJS`](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js) because you know, you want all store state to be immutable, your reducers pure, and it was all the rage back then.
For me though, the cure turned out to be worse than the disease. You could not longer just
do `state.someProp`, you had to do `state.get('someProp')`.

I rather just `...spread` all the way instead.

Immer is the solution the ReduxJS/Toolkit has adopted and I love how it allows you to write reducers
while (almost) not having to think about immutability anymore!

# createSlice and configureStore

Okay, now that we're Immer experts, let's look at the two most important
exports of the Toolkit: `createSlice` and `configureStore`.

- `configureStore`: abstracts away the horror that was `createStore`
- `createSlice`: each top level object of your store is typically a slice
- `createAsyncThunk`: add this one, and you can do everything you could with the old Redux

Part 2: createSlice and configureStore is under constuction!
