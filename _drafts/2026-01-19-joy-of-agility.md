## Introduction

In this book, Joshua Kerievsky tries to answer a key question: what does it actually look like to _be_ agile, rather than merely _do_ agile?
This distinction immediately piqued my curiosity. Having worked as a software engineering consultant since 2010, I've witnessed the full spectrum of agile implementations, from the genuinely transformative to those where organisations cherry-picked the convenient bits. Kerievsky's promise of a return to first principles through storytelling felt like precisely the perspective our industry needs.

## Structure and approach

Kerievsky organises his exploration of agility around six interconnected paradigms:

1. **Be Quick, Don't Hurry** – Distinguishing between genuine speed and reckless haste
2. **Grace** – Gaining better balance and collaborating gracefully with others
3. **Readiness** – Preparing and practising to be poised to adapt
4. **Resilience** – Taking deliberate steps to drive out fear
5. **Simplicity** – Growing a solution by starting minimal and evolving
6. **Resourcefulness** – Overcoming obstacles by being readily inventive

<!--block1-->

What makes this book distinctive is its narrative approach. Rather than prescribing yet another framework or process, Kerievsky explores one or more paradigms through a collection of standalone stories which are drawn from a wide diversity of fields. The diversity of fields is something that immediately appealed to my personal curiosity and helps showcase that the agile process is truly widely applicable.

This structure allows one to dip back into specific sections for inspiration when facing particular challenges. Found yourself rushing a release? Revisit the stories on being quick without hurrying. Team paralysed by fear of failure? The resilience section offers practical wisdom. The bite-sized setup also enables me to easily discuss one of them during a knowledge-sharing meeting, or even while waiting for a beverage.

## Strengths

The book's greatest strength lies in its accessibility. Kerievsky writes with genuine passion, and his advocacy for joy in work is particularly refreshing in an era where we tend to focus on velocity metrics and burndown charts. He reminds us that agility should lead not merely to better software, but to a more fulfilling experience for everyone involved. Agile or scrum metrics should not be used merely to prove Goodhart's law (`When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure`).

The practical nature of this book makes it easy to draw inspiration for solutions from the stories and to recommend it to a wide audience, be it a junior programmer, a senior QA tester, or just a random colleague. Everyone can find a kernel of wisdom in it.

Kerievsky also cites other well-known figures in the field, which strengthens his message.

## A minor nitpick

One of the book's major strengths occasionally works against its cohesion. The standalone, short nature of the stories may not offer the interwoven experience that some readers expect. While the takeaway at the end of each story is certainly helpful, explicitly identifying any secondary paradigms would be a valuable addition. This would help those less familiar with agile concepts to better navigate the interlinked themes.

## Who should read this book?

_The Joy of Agility_ is ideal for those who prefer learning through practical stories rather than at times dry methodology. The more nuanced and practical stories will also appeal to those who might have become somewhat jaded by more dogmatic resources. It's a book that I can recommend to seniors to draw inspiration from and to juniors to learn what being agile truly means.

For those of us who've witnessed agile's promise diluted by poor implementation, Kerievsky's work serves as a welcome reminder of what we're actually striving for: not adherence to a process, but the cultivation of a mindset which embraces adaptability, collaboration, and yes, joy.

## Other recommended books

People who enjoyed this book will likely also appreciate:

* **97 Things Every Scrum Practitioner Should Know** (Edited by Gunther Verheyen): Much like this collection, Kerievsky emphasises that agility is a culture of continuous improvement. Both works suggest that the most effective processes are those that empower the people doing the work.

* **Refactoring** (by Martin Fowler): The focus on Versatility and Readiness mirrors Fowler's technical philosophy. It reminds us that internal quality is what provides the external "grace" needed to pivot when a product's direction changes.

* **The Pragmatic Programmer** (by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas): This book shares the same "common sense" approach to excellence. It focuses on the developer's mindset and the importance of having a diverse "toolbelt" of techniques.

* **Extreme Programming Explained** (by Kent Beck): The emphasis on Resilience and Proactivity echoes Beck's early assertions that technical discipline is the key to both speed and team well-being.

## Conclusion

_The Joy of Agility_ is not another agile methodology book, but a manifesto that inspires us.
It's a recommended read for anyone genuinely interested in what it means to be agile, rather than merely doing agile.

**Rating: 9/10**
