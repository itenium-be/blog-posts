# 🎬 Devoxx 2025: The Highlights & Trends

Devoxx Belgium 2025 is a wrap, and it was an edition to remember, with an unmistakable focus on the next evolution in software: **AI Agents** and the modern **Java 25** ecosystem.
It is a real treat that the organization put the talks online so quickly, allowing us to dive straight into popular and pressing topics like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, **Stable Values**, and **Structured Concurrency**.
I’ve since done a deep-dive into the talks, and after some necessary wrestling, this is my top five.
This certainly doesn't take away from the other talks; as always, the quality was amazing.

## 1. [Top 10 Event-Driven Architecture Pitfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SnuppAHOlQ)
**Speaker:** Victor Rentea

> *"Welcome to the Event-Driven Adventure Park!"*

**Summary:**
Victor Rentea presents typical pitfalls within Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) not as dry theory, but as wild attractions in an amusement park. He covers complex distribution problems such as:
* **The "Dual Write" nightmare:** The problem of atomically saving to a database *and* sending a message.
* **Race Conditions:** When messages arrive or are processed in the wrong order.
* **The "Poison Pill":** A message that crashes the consumer and is endlessly redelivered.

**Why watch:**
This is absolutely not dry material. In his typical humorous and energetic style, Victor makes abstract problems very concrete. Definitely a must for developers interested in *war stories* who want to avoid the practical pain points of messaging systems.

## 2. [Making significant Software Architecture decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoV7d2Af2tM)
**Speaker:** Bert Jan Schrijver

**Summary:**
Bert Jan presents the complex process of making architectural choices. He warns against "Resume Driven Development" and introduces models to make decisions more objective. A key point is the **"Seagull Architecture"** anti-pattern: the architect who flies in, drops some decisions, and flies off again without bearing the consequences.

**Extra insights:**
* **Trade-offs:** Every choice is a sacrifice (e.g., consistency vs. availability).
* **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):** The importance of documenting *why* a choice was made.
* **Fitness Functions:** Automatically testing whether your architecture still complies.

**Why watch:**
A beautifully structured, non-dogmatic talk that leans on years of experience. If you are interested in the *why* behind the *what* and *how* of decisions, this is highly recommended.

## 3. [The New Java Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sjJmKXLnuY)
**Speaker:** Stephen Colebourne

**Summary:**
Stephen Colebourne gives a handy overview of how we should be writing Java *now*, as opposed to the older styles many still use.

**Key points:**
* **Var:** Use `var` for local variables to increase readability.
* **Records vs. Beans:** Use *Records* for transparent data and classic *Beans* for encapsulation.
* **Switch Expressions & Pattern Matching:** For more concise and safer code.
* **Optional:** Use `Optional` strictly as a return type.

**Why watch:**
An essential update if you don't want to get stuck in "legacy" Java patterns.

## 4. [The imperfect architect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQWWkaSEmVo)
**Speaker:** Robin Custers

**Summary:**
Robin discusses the soft side of the architect profession and the organizational challenges:
* **Political Capital:** View influence as a bank account; build up credit and spend it wisely.
* **Situational Leadership:** Adapt your leadership style to the team.
* **Stakeholders:** How to deal with resistance and forge alliances.

**Why watch:**
The perfect architect does not exist. This talk shows how to cultivate a collaborative culture without being dogmatic.

## 5. [Domain-centric? Why Hexagonal, Onion and Clean architecture are answers to the wrong question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3acmgP2Ng)
**Speaker:** Oliver Drotbohm

**Summary:**
Oliver Drotbohm raises critical questions about the hype surrounding Hexagonal and Clean architecture. He questions whether strictly separating technical layers actually serves the right goal.

**Core message:**
* **Functional vs. Technical:** Focus on *vertical slices* (functionality) instead of horizontal layers.
* **Modules:** A plea for pragmatic API design (including with **Spring Modulith**).
* **Encapsulation:** Use Java's package scope effectively instead of making everything public.

**Why watch:**
A refreshing look that makes you think: how much abstraction do you *really* need?

## Honourable Mention: [Backlog.md - Reaching 95% Task success rate with AI Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSoDQU_9MMA)
**Speaker:** Alex Gavrilescu

**Summary:**
In this talk, Alex explains how he successfully uses AI agents for software development, ranging from initial frustrations to a structured process.

**The Concept:**
He introduces **Backlog.md**, where tasks live in markdown files within your git repo.
* **Context Management:** Small, specific tasks prevent the AI from losing track.
* **Spec-Driven Development:** First generate a plan, review it, and only then code.

**Why watch:**
An honest look at the stumbling blocks of AI coding and how to solve them. The project can be found at: [https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md)
