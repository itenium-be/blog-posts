# What

A security awareness workshop disguised as a teambuilding game.


## Capture the flag

At the core of our Security Bootcamp lies the conviction that the
most effective defense is a well-informed and proactive offense.

Our workshop takes the form of a team-based game, where participants
accumulate points by uncovering vulnerabilities in our websites
(such as SQL Injection, XSS, and more).

Boost your team's score by tackling puzzles and brain-teasers,
employing a diverse set of IT tools.



## Presentations

After successfully executing a specific hack, our program includes a
comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that delves into the intricacies
of the vulnerability, along with its associated risks and how it was
exploited during the game.

We outline the attack vector and provide invaluable guidance for your developers,
equipping them with essential tips and insights for developing secure APIs
and web applications.

Your testers learn how to perform fundamental security tests to ensure
no unauthorized data access or manipulation is possible by crafting
custom requests.

Our presentations also serve as eye-openers for product owners and managers,
shedding light on the potential catastrophic consequences of these vulnerabilities
and the ease with which they can be exploited, using readily available tools.

To drive the message home, we conclude our presentations with real-world examples,
showcasing how renowned companies and products have fallen victim to these
vulnerabilities time and again, often resulting in significant financial repercussions.



## Hacking Tools

Participants directly witness the potentially severe repercussions
of vulnerable applications through engaging presentations, in-game blog posts,
and live demonstrations of powerful hacking tools,
including [nmap][nmap], [hydra][hydra], and [sqlmap][sqlmap].
