The next iteration of the itenium Security Bootcamp is at the [Michigan Technology Conference 2024](https://www.mitechcon.org/). Its vulnerable applications will be running for the duration of the conference: exploit the vulnerabilities (hack!?) and submit captured flags in the Portal website.

Here is how those that will participate can prepare themselves.

If the term `SQL Injection` does not ring a bell, you may want to start by reading up on
that and other vulnerabilities such as: XSS, CSRF, OWASP, ...

**Super Tips**:  
Statements in this blog that have a ðŸ˜‰ emoji, ignore at your own peril ðŸ˜‰


# API Key

**GUARD YOUR API KEY WITH YOUR LIFE**

Your API key is how the game keeps track of your progress.  
The API key is required to login and to submit captured flags (=score points).

You should have received yours by email.  
If you do not have an API key, contact one of the game admins.


## Teams

**Divide & Conquer**

It's possible to play in a team!


# Start Playing

At the start of the conference we will communicate how to:

- Connect to our network
- The URL of the Portal

Once you've reached the Portal, you can login with your API key
which will generate a JWT token used for authentication.



# Setting The Stage

**BREAKING NEWS**:
All MITechCon sessions STOLEN, mere days before the conference start!

It is assumed that **{{page.competitor.ceo}}** from **{{page.competitor.company}}** is behind
the theft of the priceless `{{page.competitor.zip}}` (probably because they
had insufficient material of their own).

But don't panic just yet, there is hope still: our hacker liaison discovered {{page.competitor.company}} has scheduled a major portal migration on {{page.ctf-date.start}}. We managed to secure migration API keys, which will enable us to infiltrate their portal and, with some clever hacking, retrieve our beloved zip.


# Your Tools

## Hardware

**Bring your own ethernet cable and make sure your laptop has an ethernet port!**

You do not want to perform a brute force attack on wifi, trust us.


## Software

### Hardcore

You are a seasoned hacker or really want to dive into this.

[Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali) is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards security tasks, such as Penetration Testing and Security Research.


[Metasploit][metasploit] is the world's most used penetration testing framework.  
You can install this on Windows!


### Docker

There is a Docker image for pretty much all the tools you'll need.

Already install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
and download the Docker images at home!

```sh
docker pull instrumentisto/nmap
docker pull paoloo/sqlmap
docker pull vanhauser/hydra
docker pull adminer
docker pull mongoclient/mongoclient
docker pull rediscommander/redis-commander
docker pull jrottenberg/ffmpeg
```

### Manual Install

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/): fabricating requests is necessary for certain hacks!
- Database tools: [Compass][compass] (mongo), [HeidiSQL][heidisql] (mysql), [AnotherRedisDesktopManager][redis] (redis)
- Hacking tools: [nmap][nmap], [Hydra][hydra], [sqlmap][sqlmap], [ffmpeg][ffmpeg]


[compass]: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
[heidisql]: https://www.heidisql.com/download.php
[Redis]: https://goanother.com/#download
[ffmpeg]: https://ffmpeg.org/
[nmap]: https://nmap.org/download.html
[hydra]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/thc-hydra.mirror/
[sqlmap]: https://sqlmap.org/
[metasploit]: https://www.metasploit.com/download


## Tools

See "ALSO IN THIS SERIES" for our specific blog posts on
using nmap, hydra and sqlmap.


### Chrome Dev Tools

Open Dev Tools with **F12**.  
The following tabs will be interesting for the bootcamp:

- **Application** > "Local Storage"
    - token: Your JWT token
    - user: Your details
- **Network**
    - Many hacks are performed by doing a Http request.
    - The flag is typically in the Response of such request!
    - Interesting options
        - Fetch/XHR: this is what weâ€™re interested in
        - Preserve log: do not purge the list when the page is refreshed
    - Interesting request details
        - Headers > Request Url: to see query string arguments
        - Payload: the body sent with the request
        - Response: the reply from the server
- Console
    - Interesting logs or errors may show up here


You could also monitor network traffic with a tool like
[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere)
or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)


# The Game

## The Portal

If you are unsure how to get started

- Explore The Portal website
    - Make sure to update your settings after logging in ðŸ˜‰
    - Visit the "Hacks Overview" page from the portal for extra tips
- Run an `nmap` scan on the server the Portal is served from to discover more

## In-Game Blogs

As part of the Security Bootcamp, two (vulnerable) Wordpress
blogs are spun up, visit them from the Portal for more useful information:

**The Hacker's Toolkit Blog** contains posts on hacking tools and general info on JWT, Capturing Flags and more

**The Security Audit Blog** contains clues for the treasure hunts.


## The Flags

Just performing a certain hack does not score points,
you have to locate the flag that is revealed by the hack.

Make sure to check the response body after you have performed a hack ðŸ˜‰

The following case-sensitive regex will match a flag:

```js
[A-Z]{2,5}-[a-zA-Z0-9. -]{4,50}
```

Other things that score points:

- The API key of another player not in your team
- The JWT token of another player not in your team

Check the blog post in The Hacker's Toolkit Blog in-game for more info!


## The Vault

The Vault is where {{page.competitor.ceo}} has hidden our precious zip. 
It is the end game and will open on {{page.ctf-date.vault}}.  
But you can continue playing until {{page.ctf-date.end}}, when the winners
will be announced.

Many of the flags found in the game are somehow encrypted
with [simple ciphers](https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/).

Attempt to open the Vault by entering all your decrypted flags
as passphrase and score Vault multipliers.

Beware, incorrectly decrypted flags will cost points!
