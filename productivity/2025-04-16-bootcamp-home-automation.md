For our bootcamp we try to get everyone out of their comfort zone
and, like many of our sessions, try to do something hands-on.

This year the topic of choice was "Home Automation". The day was divided
into two parts:

- Solder your own "smart socket" (and take it home with you!)
- Integrate it into one of the "smart houses" with Home Assistant

# Before we begin

A word of caution...

# üèóÔ∏èüß∞ Materials

Because we needed a lot of soldering bouts etc, we asked the consultants if they could bring
some extra equipment to the bootcamp.

# The Teams

After an initial presentation the teams got to work!

Creating our own, programmable "smart" socket with HLK-PM01 and ESP01.

# üè†‚ú® Smart Houses

We brought in some "smart houses", packed with all kinds of sensors and connected to the Wifi with
raspberry pies with the "Home Assistant OS" on them.

# The End

We ended the evening with maybe the most important part, the closing reception with discussions on
our little IoT adventure ;)  
And now to find something cool for next year! üòÄ
